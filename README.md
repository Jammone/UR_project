 Learning for Safety-Critical Control with Control Barrier Functions
Modern nonlinear control theory seeks to endow systems with properties of stability and safety, and have been deployed successfully in multiple domains. 
Despite this success, model uncertainty remains a significant challenge in synthesizing safe controllers, leading to degradation in the properties provided
by the controllers. 
In this paper the authors develop a machine learning framework utilizing Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to reduce model uncertainty as it impacts the safe
behavior of a system. In this project the students are required to implement in Matlab the method described in [1] and to test it on a Pendubot in a simulated environment.
